        # NOTE: Encoding in OFX, particularly in OFX 1.02,
        # is kind of a mess.  The OFX 1.02 spec talks about "UNICODE"
        # as a supported encoding, which the OFX 2.0 spec has
        # back-rationalized to "UTF-8".  The "US-ASCII" encoding is
        # given as "USASCII".  Yet the 1.02 spec acknowledges that
        # not everyone speaks English nor uses UNICODE, so they let
        # you throw any old encoding in there you'd like.  I'm going
        # with the idea that if the most common encodings are named
        # in an OFX file, they should be translated to "real" XML
        # encodings, and if no encoding is given, UTF-8 (which is a
        # superset of US-ASCII) should be assumed; but if a named
        # encoding other than USASCII or 'UNICODE' is given, that
        # should be preserved.  I'm also adding a get_encoding()
        # method so that we can start to survey what encodings
        # we're actually seeing, and use that to maybe be smarter
        # about this in the future.
